RachaelRay Project Requirement
====

Phase 1
----
#### Implementation of new CMS
We will adopt **Wordpress** as the CMS of choice for this project as it seems to be the correct tool to deliver the new experience.
Using a CMS such as wordpress will also offload many IT functions to the business, where users can define behavior and tasks if desired.
Furthermore, it will make code and data more manageable and will seperate business logic (content) and technical implementation (code) which will allow for
the system to be scalable. Additionally, Wordpress is very easy to use and has an intuitive interface which has been adopted by many media sites. Adding and removing
content (articles,images,pages, etc..) on a regular basis is very easy.  Because the technology is so simple  time spent on formatting is greatly reduced.

Wordpress has a vast open source community of contributors which allows us to adopt any plugin that fit our need.
